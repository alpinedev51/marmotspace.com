        About Me
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Thank you for visiting.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        My pseduonym here is the AlpineDev. I am a software engineer and specialize in cybersecurity and mathematics (primarily related to machine learning).
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        I like to explore and contribute to the world of cybersecurity—especially in areas like vulnerability analysis, adversarial machine learning, and anomaly detection.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This site is a reflection of my interests and explorations. Here, you’ll find technical deep dives, conceptual essays, and thoughts on topics at the intersection of systems, security, machine learning, and society.
      </p>


      <h2 className="mt-10 mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">Outside of Work</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        I regularly enjoy Crossfit, trail running, and climbing. I’m passionate about the outdoors, fitness, and adventure whether that’s mountain biking, surfing, or snowboarding.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This site is sort of my public notebook: expect commentary on science and tech, essays on society and philosophy, and the occasional deep dive into tools, trends, and ideas shaping the world.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        I hope you find some of the content useful and interesting. Feel free to contact me if you want to talk for whatever reason.
